        Mumu, I don’t know how to say this perfectly, but I just want you to know that you are really special to me.
Every small moment with you stays in my heart forever <br>
You make my days better without even trying.<br>

Even when we fight or misunderstand each other, I still care about you the same.
I don’t want to lose you. <br>
I’m happy you are in my life, and I hope I can stay in yours too. <br>
